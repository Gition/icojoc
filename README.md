This is a demonstration to show the impact of COVID-19 on the average speed of rush hour traffic (AM and PM) on the Montreal Metropolitan highway.
The data source is the average speed per 15-minute period over the first 5 months of 2018, 2019 and 2020 provided by HERE (https://www.here.com/).
For each year, we calculate an average harmonic speed over 24 hours, separately for 2 groups of weeks (1 to 11 and 12 to 20), and for each group of weeks, we calculate an average speed for each peak hour (AM and PM).
These results are only a demonstration and cannot be used as an official publication of my organization.
